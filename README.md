# Web-based-Navigation-with-ROSBridge
Motivation: Cloud robotics is an emerging topic in the last few years and it aims at integrating mobile robots with cloud computing systems and the Internet of Things through web services interfaces. Project Overview: use of React and JavaScript to control and monitor robot ROS navigation using Web interfaces. This didactic project comes from the series of courses "ROS for begineers" by professor and doctor Anis Koubaa. What was developed in this project: create a web interface to teleoperate a robot, develop a web interface for robot navigation, use JavaScript React front-end development and use ROSBridge to interact with ROS ecosystem.
